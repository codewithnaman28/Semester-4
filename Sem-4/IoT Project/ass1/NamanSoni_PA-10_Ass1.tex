\section{\textbf{Theory}}
\textit{\underline{Raspberry Pi Model 3B:}} Raspberry Pi Model 3B is a popular single-board computer developed by the Raspberry Pi Founda
tion. It is a successor to the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and features a quad-core ARM Cortex-A53 CPU with 1GB of RAM. The board has a variety of input/output options, including HDMI, USB, Ethernet,
and a 40-pin GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) header. It can run various operating systems, including Raspbian, Ubuntu, and Windows 10 IoT Core. Raspberry Pi 3B is used in a variety of projects, including home automation, robotics, and media centers.\\

\textit{\underline{Arduino Uno:}} On the other hand, Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a
power jack, and an ICSP header.It can be powered using a USB cable or an external power source. Arduino Uno can be programmed using the Arduino IDE, which supports a variety of programming languages, including C
and C++.It is commonly used in various projects, including home automation, robotics, and IoT applications.\\

\textit{\underline{Difference between Raspberry Pi 3B and Arduino Uno:}}
One of the main differences between Raspberry Pi 3B and Arduino Uno is their architecture. Rasp berry Pi is a full-fledged computer that can run an operating system, while Arduino Uno is a micro controller board that runs a single program.
This makes Raspberry Pi more suitable for projects that require more processing power, such as media centers or web servers. Arduino Uno, on the other hand, is more suitable for projects that require real-time control, such as robotics or home automation.
Another difference between the two is their input/output capabilities. Raspberry Pi 3B has a
variety of input/output options, including HDMI, USB, Ethernet, and a 40-pin GPIO header, making
it suitable for a wide range of projects. Arduino Uno, on the other hand, has a smaller number of input/output pins, making it suitable for simpler projects that require fewer inputs/outputs.
In terms of the Internet of Things (IoT), both Raspberry Pi 3B and Arduino Uno can be used to
create IoT applications. Raspberry Pi 3B can be used as a web server, which can be accessed remotely over the Internet.
It can also be used to interface with various sensors and actuators, making it suitable for IoT applications. Arduino Uno, on the other hand, can be used to create standalone IoT devices that can communicate with other devices over the Internet.
It can also be used to interface with various sensors and actuators, making it suitable for a wide range of IoT applications.
